            <h2>Khne Ko darr rahe h</h2>

            “  I wish I had told her…. “ , Vivaan was thinking one fine day remembering about Meera. So it all begins like this…Vivaan a student of class 11, a bright student ,an introvert ,a person who speaks a lot in his imagination but can’t express it in words. He was waiting for his holidays to get over.
 On monday the school was going to re-open after a long holiday and no one was excited to go to school except Vivaan because knew that he will be seeing Meera after a long month which was not less than eternity for him. Finally Monday arrived Vivaan entered school and his eyes searched only for Meera . Finally he was able to see her ,the shine in her eyes was like February supermoon,her hair was waving in air like the branches of tree in storm, she was not less than angel for him. Vivaan knew that he is addicted to her and loved her alot but he feared to tell her about his feelings. He feared to lose her. They never talked to each other until today because they were in different sections.
        Today was combined class for them due to less attendance which was not less than blessing in disguise for Vivaan. Vivaan somehow managed to sit behind Meera. Meera knew him because he was topper , and about his feelings for her because any gossip spreads like fire in class but she never reacted. “Will you give me notes ,because I was absent before holiday for a while” asked Meera,Vivaan stammered “Yes sure”…This was the first ever exchange of words between them and he was on cloud nine. Next day he gave his notebook to her and it was the beginning of their friendship. Everything was going fluently untill today.. Today Vivaan got to know that he is selected for Intercollege Quiz which was going to happen at Punjab and he will be going there for a 10 days trip. He was too happy because it was a great achievement for him , hardly he knew that this is going to be a turning point in his life which will shatter him.
Vivaan reached Punjab and was performing well there hardly he had time to talk to Meera but he decided after going back he will propose her he knew she will be happy by this achievement. On the last day of his trip he bought a box of chocolate for her. After reaching back to Kolkata he messeged her, “Dear Meera I always wanted to tell you something that you are the one whom I always loved but wasn’t able to confess it. I always feared that I will lose you, I always feared that I will loose our friendship…but today I am gathering all my strength to tell you that I love you a lot” ,  after sending this message he was eagerly waiting for her reply and finally reply came which broken him into thousand pieces “ I knew you love me from the day I know you.. I know how much you feel about me..but but you NEVER told me…in your absence I fell for someone and finally we are in relationship”….after reading this tears rolled down his eyes and only one sentence he uttered.. “  I wish I would had told her….this box of chocolate and my love will wait for you”.
Life is too short to keep something within you.. Just say whatever you feel to your loved ones before life takes away that opportunity from you!!
