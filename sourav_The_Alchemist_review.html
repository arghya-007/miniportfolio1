            <h2>The Alchemist</h2>

            Reading is paramount because it avails in self development and
            phrenic stimulation. I recently read “The Alchemist” after procrastinating for
            along time. I read it at an impeccable time after a friend recommended it.
            The book is lovely and an inspirational masterpiece.
            Indited by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho in 1988.It was initially indited and
            published in Portuguese. It is an international bestseller and has been
            translated to more than 70 languages. The book is relatively short having
            around 167 pages only. The theme is about finding one’s destiny or purport
            in life.
            The story is about a Shepherd boy from Spain whose designation is
            Santiago. He keeps getting the same dream about treasures that are lying
            in the Pyramids of Egypt. He embarks on a peregrination to follow his
            dream after meeting an old king who offers him magic stones and advice.
            Santiago crosses the Mediterranean and Sahara to find his treasures in
            Egypt and additionally accomplish his personal legend which is his purport
            in life. The book details his peregrination and the sundry encounters that he
            experiences when following his dream. Throughout the peregrination,
            Santiago meets many incipient people and an abundance of arduousness
            which ultimately avails him to learn and grow the entire way. Does he find
            the treasures in the Pyramids of Egypt?
            The Alchemist is a fantastic book and the storytelling is resplendent. The
            cull of words are impeccable, full of sapience and philosophy .I thoroughly
            doted it .The story is very enchanting and bursts with optimism which I
            cerebrate is very consequential in our lives .The book shows that the
            peregrination to your destiny is as consequential as the destiny itself. I dote
            how the book accentuates on the consequentiality of faith, hope and
            spirituality through the story of a mundane boy. I cerebrate this book
            appeals to everyone because we all have dreams and sometimes we just
            want someone to tell us that they may come true. Overall, ”The Alchemist”
            
            is a very exhilarating fiction novel and it deserves a space at everyone’s
            bookshelf.
            Personally, my favorite quotes from the book are “One’s Personal Legend
            (destiny) is what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when
            they are adolescent, kens what their Personal Legend is. “At that point in
            their lives, everything is pellucid and everything is possible. They are not
            trepidacious to dream, and to yearn for everything they would relish to
            optically discern transpire to them in their lives. But, as time passes, an
            abstruse force commences to convince them that it will be infeasible for
            them to realize their Personal Legend….whoever you are, or whatever it is
            that you do, when you genuinely want something, it’s because that desire
            originated in the soul of the macrocosm. It’s your mission on earth.”“If
            someone isn’t what others want them to be, the others become
            exasperated. Everyone seems to have a clear conception of how other
            people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.”
            “Love is not to be found in someone else but in ourselves; we simply
            arouse it. But in order to do that, we require the other person.”
