            <h2>Rusty Runs Away</h2>

Ruskin Bond’s, ‘Rusty Runs Away’ is the second book
followed by the prosperous first book, ‘Rusty, the Boy from
the Hills.’ The author has engendered the book in a way
that could make abecedarian verbalizers of English to
have no quandary reading this book. The story takes place
around Rusty, the protagonist of this novel. In every
chapter, Rusty meets some characters, who show him
love and care and calm him from the loss of his parents.
Though Mr. Harrison, the guardian of Rusty comports
impudent and firm, Rusty reveres him. He pays special
care to the characters like Ko Ki, Miss. Mackenzie, Puran,
a woman on Platform No.8, Daljit, Omar, Somi, Ranbir and
Kishen, who in turn returns the same with love. Rusty
longs for the love of someone, who could be amicable,
doting and caring for him because he is isolated from his
family and experiences solitude under his guardian.
Though his guardians, Mr. and Mrs. Harrison, are none
other than his own aunt and uncle, he finds arduous to join
or go about with them. Except his elusion from the school
at Arundel along with Daljit, he remains an agreeable and
astute and keenly intellective boy. Rusty accommodates a
model to the children and does not take any opportunity of
spoiling them.
I conjecture that this book could be popular for the
teenager children who are placid and placid but
sometimes having arduousness that others cannot avail.
For the adults this book could be insipid but it is
worthwhile reading. This book’s categorical reason that

makes me to cerebrate this book is good is that it does not
spoil children by giving them an erroneous model.
As an English leaner, I would relish to give five stars for it
does have some worth like edifying something. It neither
makes me bore nor gives nonessential messages and so
it deserves five stars. If I were to be an adult, I might be
giving three and a moiety stars.
