            Redmi note 9 pro is one of today's bestselling smartphone and is somewhat different than rest of its family members.Its awesome specifications makes it unique than the rest. First of all it has 6.67 inch LCD screen diaplay(1080*2400) with gorillla glass and with a 60Hz refresh rate and the aspect ratio is (20:9).The processor is 2.3GHz octa-core qualcomm snapdragon 720G which is surprisingly powerful for this segment and 4gb RAM and 64gb internal.We also get a 5020mAh battery and suppoprt of 18W fast charging.It has a hole punch camera at the top of 16MP and the quad
rear camera is of 48MP(f/1.79)+8MP+5MP+2MP AI camera with phase detection autofocus. This high resolution camera add to one of its best features.The OS is android 10 and skin is MIUI 11. This phone has a lower starting price than its precessedors just Rs 12,999/- surprisingly low because Xiaomi has made a few very interesting decisions in terms of positioning and features. It isn't easy to stay ahead of games and it goes far better than realme6 and samsung M30s. It was launched in India on 12th March 2020. Hece overall its powerful phone ans everyday work will go smoothly.
